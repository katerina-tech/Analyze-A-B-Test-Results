### Overview <a name="summary"></a>
A company has developed a new e-commerce web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.

The main goal of this project was to understand the results of an A/B test run by the website and provide statistical and practical interpretation on the test results.

### Part I - Probability <a name="1"></a>
Getting more familiar with the dataset, analyzing probabilities, and cleaning data.

### Part II - A/B Test <a name="2"></a>
Setting the hypothesis test based on the conversion rate of pages; old and new.

### Part III - Regression <a name="3"></a>
Achieve the same results of A/B testing by performing regression.

### Conclusion <a name="c"></a>
Based on the results of our analysis, we can't confirm any significant differance in conversion based on page, country, or even the interaction between them. It worth pointing out that the data is collected in a period of 22 days which may not be long enough for the results to be accurate and reflect the differences in conversion if exist.

In such case, it is recommended to keep experimenting for a longer period before making any decision.
